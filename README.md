## ðŸ’ª Challenges and Takeaways

- Learning SQL and Prisma to store user data in a PostgreSQL database was a challenge since these were all new technologies for me, but it was a great learning experience. I found creating relationships between my tables to be very effective in storing and retrieving data.
- I needed to create a system where we made sure we had up to date articles without making too many API calls. I created a check based on the category and controlled how often we would make an API call to get new articles.
- Pagination was a challenge. I needed a way to create a "endless" load more button that would load more articles or categories. I had to change the fundamental way I was fetching data from my backend to make this work.

## ðŸ’» How to install and run?

To get this app up and running, you'll need to set up a few things in your .env file. Specifically, make sure to include the following environments and variables:

- DATABASE_URL (We use PostgreSQL + Prisma), GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, and NEXTAUTH_URL, NEWS_API_KEY, WEATHER_API_KEY, OPEN_AI_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_TEST_ENV
